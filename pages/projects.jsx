          <motion.p {...motionProps}>While I haven't worked in a professional environment yet, or recieved any formal education in Computer Science or Web Development, I've come a long way on my own. I'll let my work speak for itself, so here is a list of projects I have completed and information on what I'm currently working on.</motion.p>

            <motion.p {...motionProps}>Right now, I'm currently working on my first fullstack web application. It's a social, recipe sharing application where users can upload and manage recipes in a digital cookbook, but can also share and discover recipes with other people. I also plan to implement meal planning features that will also generate a grocery list based on that meal plan. Then, you will get an estimated price, before you even go to the grocery store. <a href="https://github.com/Hazipan/recipe-box">See the project on Github.</a></motion.p>

            <motion.p {...motionProps}>This project is still in its early stages, but it is hosted and usable while it's in beta. Feel free to <a href="https://recipe-box-phi.vercel.app/">use Recipe Box</a> while I actively work on it. Just know that any data you create in the app could suddenly disappear as work on new features and since I hand built the user authentication/creation API, there may be some security holes. Let me know what you think!</motion.p>
